    <h2>What is Concrete Roots?</h2>
    <p>Concrete Roots is a look into the green forest of the concrete jungle that is NYC. Every tree plays a role in keeping the city alive — filtering air, cooling streets, and brightening our commutes. </p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Trees play a crucial role in making New York City healthier and more livable. They help reduce urban heat by shading streets and buildings and cooling the air through evapotranspiration, which is vital for combating the urban heat island effect common in dense cities <a href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands" target="_blank">(EPA, 2022)</a>.</p>

  <p>In addition to cooling, trees act as natural sound barriers that reduce noise pollution, making neighborhoods quieter and more pleasant <a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/centers/ccrc" target="_blank">(USDA Forest Service, 2020)</a>.</p>

  <p>Trees also contribute to cleaner air and water by filtering harmful pollutants like ozone, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. They absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, improving air quality and public health.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, trees increase property values—homes in leafy, well-maintained neighborhoods tend to sell for more and attract buyers faster <a href="https://www.arborday.org/value" target="_blank">(Arbor Day Foundation)</a>. Finally, urban trees provide important habitat for birds, insects, and other wildlife, supporting biodiversity even within the city.</p>
