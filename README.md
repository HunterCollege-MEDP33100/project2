# MEDP33100 - Project 2 Data Visualization

## Team members

Samantha Cobty and Daniel Martinez

## Live Demo

- Include a link to the live version of the project hosted on Render.

## Project Overview
Our aim is to help users learn about LinkNYC kiosks. Our site provides live information about the kiosks’ location, wifi status, and tablet accessibility. Users can visualize the accessibility of these kiosks through the interactive map display and live kiosk count displayed on the site.

## Features
We include a live and interactive map display which is used to show off kiosk location in which the user is able to sift through kiosks with active/inactive WiFi, active/inactive tablets, and or display all kiosks present in New York City. This is achieved through clicking buttons above the map.
We've implemented a tracking system used to see how many concurrent kiosks are on the map based on the filter chosen.
We also tracked how many kiosks are in each borough.

## Future Enhancements
Implementing more backend stuff, optimizing loading times, caching fetch call, better design, a more indepth stat line on borough division using graphs, a search function for speicifc address could be cool, and maybe adding animation/better UI design.
