## Project Overview
Purpose of the project:
Our project, My Listening Station, is an interactive website where users can explore music in different ways by city, mood, genre, or decade. We wanted to make it easier for people to discover new songs and connect with music that fits their personality, emotions, or location.

Live data set used:
We used the Spotify API, which gives us live information about songs, artists, and playlists. With this data, users can see how music styles and trends change depending on where you are, what you’re feeling, or what time period you’re interested in.

## Features
Select by City: Click map markers to see playlists for that city.

Select by Mood, Genre, or Era: Click buttons to view playlists for a chosen mood, genre, or decade.

View & Open Playlists: See playlist info and open them directly in Spotify.

## Technologies Used

Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Libraries: Leaflet.js (interactive maps)

APIs: Spotify API (live playlist data)

Other Tools: Express.js (backend), VS Code (development)

## Credits

Spotify Web API – used to access playlists by city, mood, style/genre, and time period.

Render – used to host our live project.

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery for interactive elements.

Backend: Node.js and Express for server-side code and API connections.

Design tools: Figma (for layout planning) and Google Fonts (for typography).

Visual inspiration and icons: Free images from Google and icons from Font Awesome.

## Future Enhancements

Implement user profiles or saved playlists so visitors can favorite or revisit their picks.

Create animated visuals (like P5.js or CSS animations) that react to the playlist’s mood or genre.

Include local artist recommendations once a suitable API or dataset becomes available.
