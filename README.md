# MEDP33100 - Project 2 Data Visualization

## Team members

Samantha Cobty and Daniel Martinez

## Live Demo

- Include a link to the live version of the project hosted on Render.

## Project Overview

Our project is to simply bring to the attention of the people the nearest LinkNYC Kiosk near them and 

- Briefly describe the purpose of the project.
- Explain what live data set was used, and what you hope users would learn about the data set by using your project

## Features
We include a live map display which is used to show off kiosk location in which the user is able to sift through kiosks with active/inactive WiFi, active/inactive tablets, and or display all kiosks present in New York City. We've implemented a tracking system used to see how many concurrent kiosks are on the map and in each specific borough.
- List all (at least 3) distinct types of user interaction, such as filtering, sorting, modifying data views, or changing the data presentation.

## Technologies Used

Languages Used, HTML, CSS, and JS
Library used, Leaflet

## Credits

- List any third-party assets used in the project (e.g., sound effects, images, fonts) and provide proper attribution.
- Acknowledge any resources, tutorials, or references you used to help complete the project.

## Future Enhancements

Implementing more backend stuff, optimizing loading times, caching fetch call, better design, a more indepth stat line on borough division using graphs, a search function for speicifc address could be cool, and maybe adding animation/better ui design.

- List any features you would’ve liked to add if given more time
