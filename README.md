## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the conditions that trees are in and how we should bring awareness to the health of trees all across the city. We would also like to provide information of said trees like what their species is as well as general tree facts that would get the user to be intruiged by our site. They'll be greeted with a map once they boot the page up and they'll see different markers on the map and a key would be provided to show them what each color would signify and have buttons / tabs that users can click that would demonstrate which trees are in the excellent, good, fair, poor, critical & dead conditions.

The data set that was used is the Forestry Trees API, it gave us many different kinds of data like the location of certain trees, their condition, what species 
of tree they are & many more. We specifically used the location of the trees given as well as the trees current condition. I hope users come out of this seeing how 
there are a high or rather an alarming amount of dead trees all across the city and there's very few excellenet trees. As trees live on and the condition of them worses over time due to pollution and climate change, their health is going to get worse and worse and we will see more trees enter in the Critical category rather than be in the good or excellent ones. 

## Features

The different kinds of user interactions we have is filtering data, changing the data presentation, & an interactive map. We can filter the data out so that it would only showcase how many trees are dead all acrosss the city and would only show those trees across the map. An interactive map that has markers that showcase which trees have different conditions. Lastly changing the data presentation would be from sorting, once you click on the excellent button, it would show the excellent trees, the good button shows the good trees and so on.
